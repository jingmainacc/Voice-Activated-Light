<h1>AI/ML Trained Voice Activated Light</h1>

 ### [MyAlexa Website Deployed in HuggingFace]
<h2>Description</h2>
Developed a voice-controlled light system that responds to voice commands to turn a light on or
off. Created an interactive system that recognizes specific keywords to control lighting. Successfully deployed a
system that accurately detected keywords and controlled the light, demonstrating effective training and
development of a machine learning model for practical audio processing applications

<br />


<h2>Technologies Used:</h2>

- Programming Languages: Python
- Libraries and Tools: PyAudio, Wave, Torchaudio, PyTorch, Tkinter
- Model: Custom SimpleCNN, trained on a dataset of audio recordings with keywords

<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- <b>HuggingFace Website</b>
